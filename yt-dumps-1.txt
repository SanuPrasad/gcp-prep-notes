1) Which gCP service below provides a direct physical connection between your GCP environment and your
on-premises network using gCP network co-locations?
A. Cloud VPN
B. Carrier Peering
c. Dedicated Interconnect
D. Partner Interconnect

Correct Answer: C
Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, highly available connections that enable you to reliably transfer data
between your on-premises and Virtual Private Cloud networks. Also, Cloud Interconnect connections provide l
1918 communication, which means internal (private) IP addresses are directly accessible from both networks.
Cloud Interconnect offers two options for extending your on-premises network. Google Cloud Interconnect -
Dedicated (Dedicated Interconnect) provides a direct physical connection between your on-premises network and
Google's network. Google Cloud Interconnect - Partner (Partner Interconnect) provides connectivity between your
on-premises and CP VPC networks through a supported service provider.

2) Steve is the cloud admin for Blue Widget Corp. He has been asked to configure a Kubernetes-hosted
app so that it can be accessed internally by the KE cluster. It will NOT be accessed from the public
internet. Which service is suitable for exposing an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be
accessed from the public internet?
A. NodePort
B. ClusterIP
C. LoadBalancer
D. ExternalName

Correct Answer: B
ClusterIP services expose an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be accessed from the public
internet. NodePort services expose the node's IP address on a specific port. LoadBalancer and
ExternalName services both work closely with your cloud provider. The former works with your provider's
load balancer resources to expose a set of pods while the latter returns a NAME record based a DNS name
of your choosing.

3) Which of the following Kubernetes controllers should be used for maintenance operations that must run
with exactly one pod running on each node?
A. DaemonSet
B. ReplicaSet
C. StatefulSet
D. Deployment

Correct Answer: A
DaemonSets attempt to adhere to a one-Pod-per-node model, either across the entire cluster or a
subset of nodes. As you add nodes to a node pool, DaemonSets automatically add Pods to the new
nodes as needed.

4) You want to configure autohealing for network load balancing for a group of Compute Engine instances that
run in multiple zones, using the fewest possible steps.
You need to configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. What
should you do?
A. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an
existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)
B. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an
existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.
C. Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy
(HTTP)
D. Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.

5) Jennifer is the cloud admin for the Blue Widget Corp. She has been asked to deploy a Kubernetes cluster
so that the organizaton can perform some testing of a containerized app. After creating the cluster, her
teams begins testing. Thirty days later, Jennifer's team informs her the the cluster appears to have been
deleted. Nobody on the team has deleted the cluster. What is likely the cause of this?
A. Jennifer deployed a private cluster with a 30-day
window
B. Jennifer deployed a zonal cluster
C. Jennifer deployed a dev cluster
D. Jennifer deployed an alpha cluster

Correct Answer: D
Alpha clusters expire after thirty days and do not receive security updates. You must migrate your
data from alpha clusters before they expire. GKE does not automatically save data stored on alpha
clusters.

6) You are deploying an application to App Engine. You want the number of instances to scale based on
request rate. You need at least 3 unoccupied instances at all times. Which scaling type should you use?
A. Manual Scaling with 3 instances.
B. Basic Scaling with min instances set to 3.
C. Basic Scaling with max_instances set to 3.
D. Automatic Scaling with min_idle_instances set to 3.

7) As the GCP admin in your organization, you need to perform some tasks using the Google Cloud SDK,
using your Windows 10 workstation. To begin using the SDK on your workstation, you've created a Google
Cloud Platform project, downloaded the Google Cloud SDK installer, and completed the installation.
At this point, you need to initialize the SDK. Which command do you use to complete this task?
A. initialize cloud
B. gcloud init
C. gcloud start
D. start gcloud
Correct Answer: B
To begin using the SDK on a local Windows workstation, you must first cate a Google Cloud Platform
project, if you don't have one already. You then need to download the Google Cloud SDK installer and
complete the installation.
After the installation completes, you must initialize the SDK, using the cloud init command.

8) Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a large
number of instances on Compute Engine. Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the
servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and
must be able to determine who accessed a given instance. What should you do?
A. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team.
Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.
B. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their
public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.
C. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public
key to their Google account. Grant the compute.osAdminLogin role to the Google group
corresponding to this team.
D. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team, for preeise see
Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platf
and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.
