1) Which gCP service below provides a direct physical connection between your GCP environment and your
on-premises network using gCP network co-locations?
A. Cloud VPN
B. Carrier Peering
c. Dedicated Interconnect
D. Partner Interconnect

Correct Answer: C
Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, highly available connections that enable you to reliably transfer data
between your on-premises and Virtual Private Cloud networks. Also, Cloud Interconnect connections provide l
1918 communication, which means internal (private) IP addresses are directly accessible from both networks.
Cloud Interconnect offers two options for extending your on-premises network. Google Cloud Interconnect -
Dedicated (Dedicated Interconnect) provides a direct physical connection between your on-premises network and
Google's network. Google Cloud Interconnect - Partner (Partner Interconnect) provides connectivity between your
on-premises and CP VPC networks through a supported service provider.

2) Steve is the cloud admin for Blue Widget Corp. He has been asked to configure a Kubernetes-hosted
app so that it can be accessed internally by the KE cluster. It will NOT be accessed from the public
internet. Which service is suitable for exposing an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be
accessed from the public internet?
A. NodePort
B. ClusterIP
C. LoadBalancer
D. ExternalName

Correct Answer: B
ClusterIP services expose an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be accessed from the public
internet. NodePort services expose the node's IP address on a specific port. LoadBalancer and
ExternalName services both work closely with your cloud provider. The former works with your provider's
load balancer resources to expose a set of pods while the latter returns a NAME record based a DNS name
of your choosing.

3) Which of the following Kubernetes controllers should be used for maintenance operations that must run
with exactly one pod running on each node?
A. DaemonSet
B. ReplicaSet
C. StatefulSet
D. Deployment

Correct Answer: A
DaemonSets attempt to adhere to a one-Pod-per-node model, either across the entire cluster or a
subset of nodes. As you add nodes to a node pool, DaemonSets automatically add Pods to the new
nodes as needed.
